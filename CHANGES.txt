Changes
-------

0.8.0 (2010-10-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adapted test set up to the changes in `z3c.layer.pagelet` 1.9 thus
  requiring at least this version now.

- Moved code from page template of session credentials login page to view
  class so it can be customized. (Taken from
  `zope.app.authentication.browser.loginform.LoginForm`.) Moved view class
  ``SessionCredentialsLoginForm`` from `z3c.authviewlet.auth` to
  `z3c.authviewlet.session`.

0.7.0 (2009-12-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Moved files in `z3c.authviewlet.browser` to `z3c.authviewlet` as
  we only have browser code in this package.

- Broke dependency on `zope.app.publisher` by defining our own
  ``ILogin`` interface.

0.6.0 (2009-12-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added `i18n domains` to allow translation (done in `z3c.locales` package).

0.5.0 (2009-11-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Moved authentication viewlet implementation from `z3c.layer.pagelet`
  to this package.

- Initial release.
